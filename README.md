# Next.js View Transitions v2

> Exploring Next.js viewTransition with Card Animations

I've been experimenting with the new Next.js beta feature:

```js
export const experimental = { viewTransition: true }
```

It integrates the browser's new View Transitions API, enabling smooth card-to-page animations without extra libraries.

In this demo, a card expands into a full page view ‚Äî powered natively by the browser + Next.js.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone & run
git clone https://github.com/adelpro/nextjs-view-transitions-v2.git
cd nextjs-view-transitions-v2
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

## üé® What it does

- **Smooth transitions**: Cards seamlessly expand into full pages
- **Zero dependencies**: Uses native browser View Transitions API
- **Effortless implementation**: Just add `experimental.viewTransition = true`
- **TypeScript + Tailwind**: Clean, modern stack

## üîß How it works

The magic happens in two places:

1. **Enable the feature** in your page/layout:
   ```js
   export const experimental = { viewTransition: true }
   ```

2. **Style your transitions** with CSS:
   ```css
   ::view-transition-old(root) {
     animation: fade-out 0.3s ease-out;
   }
   
   ::view-transition-new(root) {
     animation: fade-in 0.3s ease-in;
   }
   ```

That's it. The browser handles the rest.
